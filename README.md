# Zip and Unzip Utility Project

## Summary  
The **Zip and Unzip Utility** is a simple project to demonstrate file compression and decompression techniques. The project is implemented using **Java**  to efficiently compress multiple files into a single archive and extract them when needed.  

## Features  
- Compress multiple files into a `.zip` archive.  
- Extract files from a `.zip` archive to a specified directory.  
- Support for adding files dynamically to an existing archive.  
- User-friendly command-line interface for easy operation.  

## Implementation Details  
- The project is written in **Python** for simplicity and portability.  
- The `zipfile` module is used to create and extract ZIP files.  
- A command-line interface is provided to allow users to specify file paths and actions.  
- Error handling mechanisms ensure smooth execution.  

## Conclusion  
This project serves as a foundational introduction to file compression concepts and demonstrates how ZIP archives work in real-world applications. It is a useful utility for students learning about file handling and data storage efficiency. Future enhancements could include a graphical user interface (GUI) and support for other compression formats like `.tar.gz` or `.rar`.
